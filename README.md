A presentation on why Typescript + React = :)

# Typescript + React (and maybe other things)
- Our goal is to give some real-world Typescript examples
- We're using React as the main example for framework, but anything could work here
- Yes, even jQuery
- Yes, even Prototype

## Why Typescript?
- ES6, with types.
- Helps you write large applications in Javascript
- Gives you clearer documentation and fewer bugs
- Allows for static analysis

## Step 1: Convert your project to Typescript


## Type Casting

## Using Types

## Intersection & Union Types

## Leveraging Generics
- Generics allow you to have a "fill-in" for a type
- `Component<Props, State>` lets us know what props and state we're using
- *Use actions as an example*

## Index & Mapped Types

## Integrating Existing Libraries

## Writing your own definitions
